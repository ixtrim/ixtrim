<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Â¡BIENVENIDO!</h1>

__I am Sara, a web developer based in Barcelona.__

Whoever you are, your presence here means that I may have (or be) something you are looking for. But before we get down to business, let me introduce myself.

My name is Sara KoziÅ„ska. I was born on 21.10.1987 in Warsaw, Poland. Currently I live in sunny Barcelona, Spain, where I live with my stubborn (but still cute) French bulldog Lilo.

Since I can remember I have 3 passions: animals, boards (skateboard, snowboard, wakeboard, surfing...) and computers. To this day they are all part of my life. Over time, other interesting things were added, such as cooking (Mexican and Asian cuisine), drumming, music, filmmaking, traveling and self-development (spiritual development).

I love that my work is constantly evolving and the lines between my job and personal interests are blurred. I enjoy being surrounded by people who are just as passionate about their careers as they are about their hobbies.

<h2>ðŸ‘€ Currently i am open to new challenges!</h2>

The first website I wrote was for a class project in high school. It was a simple website with Macromedia Flash animations. Immediately, I knew this was what I wanted to do. With logic challenges as well as freedom to be creative, coding became a love affair for me.

During my studies in Information Technology, I have already worked as WebDeveloper for Film and Art Festival TWO RIVERSIDES (Summer time) and FAMA PR Agency. At that time, the most popular CMS was Joomla. I also used a lot of Flash (Macromedia, then Adobe. Since the very beginning, I created my own themes - commercial page builders were never my thing.

After a few years, as the industry requirements changed, I used other content management systems (Joomla, WordPress, PrestaShop, Drupal, Magento). Whenever I work on a project, I pay close attention to the client's specifications so that it is tailored to their needs. In order for a project to remain viable for as long as possible, it should be fast, scalable, and well-coded.

My career has been challenging and rewarding. I have learned a great deal and have enjoyed expanding my skills and knowledge base.
